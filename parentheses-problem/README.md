You are given a string that may contain any number of parentheses "("
and ")".
Remove from the string the minimum number of parentheses so that the
remaining parentheses are balanced.
Return the resulting string.

Consider the following examples.

```
"()())()" -> "()()()" or "(())()"
"(bla)(ble))(bli)" -> "(bla)(ble)(bli)" or "(bla(ble))(bli)"
")(" -> ""
")))" -> ""
```
