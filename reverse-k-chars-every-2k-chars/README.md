Given a string and an integer `k`, reverse the first `k`
characters for every `2k` characters.

If there are less than `k` characters left, reverse all of them. If
there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to k characters,
then reverse the first `k` characters and leave the rest alone.

For example, for string `xyzabcd1234` and `k = 3`, the output is
`zyxabc21d34`.
