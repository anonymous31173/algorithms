# Problem

Determine if a string is periodic.  A string is periodic when it
consists of another string concatenated one or more times.

For example, `xyxy` is periodic because the string consists of `xy`
concatenated once.  Another example, `121` is not periodic because
there is no way to divide the string in substrings that are the same.
Yet another example, the empty string is periodic because it is the
concatenation of the empty string with the empty string.
